   to create or whose character sheet you want to load (case-sensitive).

   (C)haracter sheet: Toggle Character Sheet
   (R)est: Sleep to gain health points
   (M)ap and travel: Toggle Map to find yourself, items and to travel
   (Q)uit: Save current status and quit the world of Back in a Minute

   Travelling and resting involves the risk of being attacked by the creatures
   inhabiting the different scenarios. Some places are safer than others.

     for a stretch of road. He is a likeable fellow, so when he asks if he
     could share a campfire with you and finally get some much needed rest in
     these strange lands, you comply.

     The following day he presents you with a brilliant emerald that he says
     will help you sleep whenever you need to get some rest. Or at least
     fetch you a good price at the market. Then you bid each other farewell.

     You are taken captive by a cunning gnome with magic boots, holding you
     with a spell that can only be broken by guessing his riddles.
     After a day and a night in captivity you decide to counter his riddles
     with one of your own: "What Creature of the Forest is terribly Red and
     Whiny, and Nothing Else without the Shiny?"
     
     The gnome ponders to and fro, talking to himself and spitting, as he gets
     more and more agitated. At last, furious, he demands "Show me!" and 
     releases you from the spell. Before he knows it you've stripped off his

     and old equipment destroyed by the wet. Suddenly you realize that you are
     standing on the remains of a centuries old, long forgotten battlefield.
