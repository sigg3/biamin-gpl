   Go to Main Menu and hit (P)lay and enter the NAME of the character you want
   to create or whose character sheet you want to load (case-sensitive).
   You enter the World of Back in a Minute. The first sector is Home.
   
   Each sector gives you these action alternatives:
   (C)haracter sheet: Toggle Character Sheet
   (R)est: Sleep to gain health points
   (M)ap and travel: Toggle Map to find yourself, items and to travel
   (Q)uit: Save current status and quit the world of Back in a Minute
   Use W, A, S, D keys to travel North, West, South or East directly.
      
   Travelling and resting involves the risk of being attacked by the creatures
   inhabiting the different scenarios. Some places are safer than others.

     She gives you a blessing and the Gift of Sight in return for your help.

     You encounter a strange merchant from east of all maps who joins you
     for a stretch of road. He is a likeable fellow, so when he asks if he
     could share a campfire with you and finally get some much needed rest in
     these strange lands, you comply.

     The following day he presents you with a brilliant emerald that he says
     will help you sleep whenever you need to get some rest. Or at least
     fetch you a good price at the market. Then you bid each other farewell.

     You are taken captive by a cunning gnome with magic boots, holding you
     with a spell that can only be broken by guessing his riddles.
     After a day and a night in captivity you decide to counter his riddles
     with one of your own: "What Creature of the Forest is terribly Red and
     Whiny, and Nothing Else without the Shiny?"
     
     The gnome ponders to and fro, talking to himself and spitting, as he gets
     more and more agitated. At last, furious, he demands "Show me!" and 
     releases you from the spell. Before he knows it you've stripped off his
     boots and are running away, magically quicker than your normal pace.

     of the forests, roads and mountains in the old world, that seek every

     lowlife in the surrounding area.

     From the thickest of forests you come upon and traverse a huge unmarked 
     marsh and while crossing, you stumble upon trinkets, shards of weaponry
     and old equipment destroyed by the wet. Suddenly you realize that you are
     standing on the remains of a centuries old, long forgotten battlefield.

     On the opposite side, you climb a mound only to find the wreckage of a
     chariot, crashed on retreat, its knight pinned under one of its wheels.
     You salvage a beautiful piece of craftmanship from the wreckage;
     a powerful two-handed broadsword, untouched by time.
